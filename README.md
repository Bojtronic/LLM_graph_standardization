# LLM_Graph_Standardization

## 📚 Project Overview

**Standardization of Transformer-Based Attention Network Execution for Pattern-Level Optimizations in Graphs.**  

This project aims to address the fragmentation in the implementation of inference services for transformer-based models by proposing a standard for graph representation. The standard ensures optimal utilization of hardware accelerators (GPUs and FPGAs) and introduces a GGML-based application tailored for models such as LLAMA 2, LLAMA 3, ViT, and Whisper.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Graph Representation Analysis**  
   Analyze the graph representation in GGML-based applications to identify common patterns that optimize the execution of transformer-based networks on high-performance hardware. This includes studying graph construction and management in models such as LLAMA 2, LLAMA 3, ViT, and Whisper.

2. **Standard Design for Graph Execution**  
   Design a standard for graph representation and execution, establishing operations, hierarchies, and structures compatible with parallel computing architectures (HPC). The standard ensures seamless integration with embedded systems equipped with GPUs and FPGAs.

3. **GGML-Based Application Implementation**  
   Implement a GGML-based application to process the execution graphs of LLAMA 2 and ViT models following the designed standard, ensuring efficient execution on specialized hardware.

4. **Execution Graph Optimization**  
   Optimize the LLAMA 2 execution graph using the **layer fusion** technique. The goal is to maximize parallelism and leverage the full computational capabilities of accelerated hardware.

5. **Performance Evaluation**  
   Evaluate the impact of the developed standard and application through rigorous performance testing. Analyze key metrics such as scalability and execution time reduction to validate efficiency.
